		<h2> Summary:</h2>
		<p>This is a summary about Toby Fox, and how he created my favorite games, Undertale and Deltarune. His most well-known work is his 2015 role-playing video game Undertale.The game sold for 1 milion copies, becoming a "breakout hit" and "pop-culture phenomenon." He worked on this entire game independently, besides the art assets (which he asked Temmie Chang to help with) to avoid relying on others. He had some experience before he created Undertale using RPG Maker 2000 with his three brothers to make role-playing games and Earthbound ROM hacks in high school. The most notable of which was Earthbound: The Halloween Hack. He thought of the character designs and ideas for Undertale while in collage, where he drew them in his notebook. In 2016, he released a nummber of unused musical tracks from undertale. Toby also became a contributor to the "A Profound Waste of Time" magazine. He was chosen to be part of the 2018 Games Forbes 30 Under 30 list for his role in creating Undertale.

		On October 30, 2018, Fox tweeted a request for fans of Undertale to check the game's official Twitter account in 24 hours. The following day, he released the first chapter of the follow up to Undertale,named Deltarune, for free under the guise of a "servey".
		On November 1, he shared more deatails about the game, inculding that the rest of the chapters were expected to release simutaneously, but work had not yet started, and there was not an estemated time frame for competion. Fox stated that he had been working on the project since 2012, and the idea for Undertale developed from Deltarune during production. On June 12, 2019,as only the first chapter of Deltarune had been playable for several months, He expressed on his Twitter account he had hope he would complete the rest of Deltarune, saying: "Slowly  I'm writing and drawing it all out."Toby stated that he has writen "about 50 songs past Chapter 1" On September 17, 2021, Fox relesed the second chapter of Deltarune for free since the "world has been tough recently". He plans to Release the next chapters simutaneously with a price greater that Undertale, but without any projected relese date.

<h2>My favorite quote from Toby Fox:</h2>
	<p>“But you didn't get this far by giving up, did you? That's right. You have something called 'determination'. So as long as you hold on, so as long as you do what's in your heart, I believe you can do the right thing.”</p>
